This basic app was built on android studio to fulfill project requirement of some course. It includes many basic functionalities such as button which triggers an action when clicked, display a pop-up message ("toast"), display a list of items to choose from,  display an image,  display a web page, composed of many linked activities, and pass information from one activity to the next
My Gym-buddy App-
This app serves as a gym trainer for those who have gym access nearby but lack trainer facility there. Especially useful for college/ hostel students who have free gym services provided in there campus or public gyms but without trainer. This app provides a well planned workout schedule body-part-wise with video tutorials of exercises.

Main Screen:
The app opens with heading at top "Choose your workout part for today". In the middle it has a list of body parts as options. When any of the option is selected and "Let's do it" button is hit then user is taken to a particular next screen based on that option.

Screen 2 (next screen):
Based on your choice the screen will show the list of exercises of that particular body-part arranged serialwise according to a fixed plan each with a image (linked with a video tutorial) and checkbox right next to the name of that exercise . Once the user is done with that exercise then he/she may tick that checkbox. When Image is clicked then a web page will open containing video tutorial of that exercise. Two buttons(Done and Choose other part) are provided at bottom. 
Functioning  of buttons:
1. Done button: If more than 3  checkboxes are ticked then it will pop-up a message "Well done!" and takes back to main page otherwise pop-up message will be "try harder" and same activity will remain
2. Choose other part button: It will take back to Main screen if user wishes to choose other body-part option.
Clicking image- Clicking a particular image will take you to the video tutorial of that exercise.
Click for more - It links to a webpage where user can find some more exercises of that part.
The idea behind the app is very simple and was built in motivation to cover as many building blocks taught in this course.
